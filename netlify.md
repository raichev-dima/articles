At Epicmax we've recently decided to move our hosting provider from Railway to Netlify as we are going towards the Netlify's Open Source team plan which includes at the time of writing:
- 1TB bandwidth per month
- 25000 build minutes per month
- 2M edge functions invocations per month
- Up to 3 concurrent builds

## What are the other benefits of Netlify comparing to Railway? 

1. Specialized in Jamstack architectures (JS, APIs and Markup), whereas Railway is good for container-based stack
2. Forms, Edge functions, Blobs, Image CDN, Cache Control, and analytics [out of the box](https://docs.netlify.com/platform/primitives/). 

  For instance, this is how real use metrics would look like:

  Forms look very promising (haven't tried it yet, here's the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)):

3. Supportive ecosystem and community

E.g., Netlify has an impressive list of 3rd party integrations:

And you can always build your own deep integrations and connectors with the Netlify SDK.

4. Powerful and well documented CLI tools
5. Flexible tuning for your branches and deploy contexts. Now we can build a preview for any commit, check it out via unique URL and then deploy for production for just a matter of several minutes.
